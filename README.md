### Installation
---
Elegantish requires [Jirafeau], it is not a standalone app.

Elegantish is released under the same [GNU AGPLv3][licence] licence as [Jirafeau], it is essentially the same code after all.

Installation is easy, just a few steps.
  1. Download the [Latest Release]
  2. Extract the downloaded .zip
  3. Move/upload the directory 'elegantish' to your Jirafeau 'media' directory
  4. Edit `config.local.php` and change the `$cfg['style']` variable to `elegantish`

**Example:** *lib/config.local.php*
``` 
$cfg['style'] = 'elegantish';
```

That's it! Enjoy and feel free to modify it to your hearts content.
